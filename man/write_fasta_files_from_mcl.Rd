\usage{

  write_fasta_files_from_mcl(path_to_ys = pkgconfig::get_config("baitfindR::path_to_ys"),
  all_fasta, mcl_outfile, minimal_taxa = 4, outdir, get_hash, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_to_ys}{Character vector of length one; the path to the folder containing Y&S python scripts, e.g., "/Users/me/apps/phylogenomic_dataset_construction/"}

\item{all_fasta}{Character vector of length one; the path to the fasta file including all query sequences concatenated together, i.e., the fasta file used to create the "all-by-all" blast database.}

\item{mcl_outfile}{Character vector of length one; the path to the output from running mcl on blast distances.}

\item{minimal_taxa}{Numeric; minimal number of taxa required to be present for the cluster to be written. Default 4, the minimum number of taxa needed for an un-rooted tree.}

\item{outdir}{Character vector of length one; the path to the folder where the clusters should be written.}

\item{get_hash}{Logical; should the 32-byte MD5 hash be computed for all clusters concatenated together? Used for by \code{\link{drake}} for tracking during workflows. If \code{TRUE}, this function will return the hash.}

\item{...}{Other arguments. Not used by this function, but meant to be used by \code{\link{drake}} for tracking during workflows.}
}
\value{
One fasta file per cluster (\code{cluster1.fa}, \code{cluster2.fa}, etc.) will be written to \code{outdir}. If \code{get_hash} is \code{TRUE}, the 32-byte MD5 hash be computed for all \code{.fa} files concatenated together will be returned.

\description{
Wrapper for Yang and Smith (2014) write_fasta_files_from_mcl.py
}
\details{
Given the output from the mcl clustering algorthim and a concatenated fasta file
including all sequences used for clustering, outputs one fasta file per cluster
including the sequences in that cluster.

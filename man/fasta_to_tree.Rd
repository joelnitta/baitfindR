\usage{
fasta_to_tree(path_to_ys = pkgconfig::get_config("baitfindR::path_to_ys"),
  overwrite = FALSE, seq_folder, number_cores, seq_type, bootstrap = FALSE,
  get_hash = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_to_ys}{Character vector of length one; the path to the folder containing Y&S python scripts, e.g., \code{"/Users/me/apps/phylogenomic_dataset_construction/"}}

\item{overwrite}{Logical; should previous output of this command be erased so new output can be written? Once erased it cannot be restored, so use with caution!}

\item{seq_folder}{Character vector of length one; the name of the folder containing the fasta files.}

\item{number_cores}{Numeric; number of threads to use for \code{RAxML} and \code{mafft}.}

\item{seq_type}{Character vector of length one indicating type of sequences. Should either be \code{"dna"} for DNA or \code{"aa"} for proteins.}

\item{bootstrap}{Logical; should run a bootstrap analysis be run for the trees?}

\item{get_hash}{Logical; should the 32-byte MD5 hash be computed for all output tree files concatenated together? Used for by \code{\link{drake}} for tracking during workflows. If \code{TRUE}, this function will return the hash.}

\item{...}{Other arguments. Not used by this function, but meant to be used by \code{\link{drake}} for tracking during workflows.}
}
\value{
(For "small" clusters). For each input cluster \code{cluster1.fa} in \code{seq_folder}, \code{cluster1.fa.mafft.aln} (aligned cluster), \code{cluster1.fa.mafft.aln-cln} (cleaned, aligned cluster), and \code{cluster1.raxml.tre} (maximum-likelihood tree) will be written to \code{seq_folder}. If \code{get_hash} is \code{TRUE}, the 32-byte MD5 hash be computed for all \code{.raxml.tre} files concatenated together will be returned.

\description{
Wrapper for Yang and Smith (2014) \code{fasta_to_tree.py}
}
\details{
Given a folder containing unaligned sequences in fasta format (i.e., clusters),
aligns each cluster with \code{mafft} (small alignments) or \code{pasta} (large alignments),
excludes poorly aligned sites with \code{phyutility}, and infers a maximum-likelihood
tree with \code{RAxML} (small alignments) or \code{fasttree} (large alignments). Requires all
of these programs to be installed and included in the user's \code{$PATH}. Assumes clusters are named \code{"cluster1.fa"}, \code{"cluster2.fa"}, etc.

\description{
Creates a directory in the working directory, and adds a hidden \code{.name} file,
which is a plain text file containing the name of the directory. The purpose of
the \code{.name} file is to allow for tracking by \code{\link[drake]{drake_plan}}
during workflows, because \code{\link[drake]{drake_plan}} can only track files,
not folders.

\usage{
trim_tips(path_to_ys = pkgconfig::get_config("baitfindR::path_to_ys"),
  tree_folder, tree_file_ending, relative_cutoff, absolute_cutoff,
  get_hash = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_to_ys}{Character vector of length one; the path to the folder containing Y&S python scripts, e.g., \code{"/Users/me/apps/phylogenomic_dataset_construction/"}}

\item{tree_folder}{Character vector of length one; the name of the folder containing the trees to trim.}

\item{tree_file_ending}{Character; string used to match tree files that should be trimmed.}

\item{relative_cutoff}{Numeric vector of length one; tips on a branch 10 times longer than their sister AND longer than this value will be cut.}

\item{absolute_cutoff}{Numeric vector of length one; tips on branches longer than this value will be cut.}

\item{get_hash}{Logical; should the 32-byte MD5 hash be computed for all output trimmed tree files concatenated together? Used for by \code{\link{drake}} for tracking during workflows. If \code{TRUE}, this function will return the hash.}

\item{...}{Other arguments. Not used by this function, but meant to be used by \code{\link{drake}} for tracking during workflows.}
}
\value{
For each input tree with a file ending matching \code{tree_file_ending} in \code{tree_folder}, a trimmed tree with a file ending in \code{.tt} will be written to \code{tree_folder}. If \code{get_hash} is \code{TRUE}, the 32-byte MD5 hash be computed for all trimmed tree files concatenated together will be returned.

\description{
Wrapper for Yang and Smith (2014) \code{trim_tips.py}
}
\details{
Given a folder containing phylogenetic trees, exclude (i.e., "trim"),
tips on unusually long branches. Tips on a branch 10 times longer
than their sister AND longer than \code{relative_cutoff}, OR tips
that are longer than \code{absolute_cutoff} will be trimmed. This
function will overwrite any output files with the same name in
\code{tree_folder}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{trim_tips(tree_folder = "some/folder/containing/tree/files", tree_file_ending = ".tre", relative_cutoff = 0.2, absolute_cutoff = 0.4)}
